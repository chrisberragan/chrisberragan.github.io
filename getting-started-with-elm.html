            <a href="http://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a> is a purely functional programming language, very
            similar to Haskell, that compiles into Javascript and simplifies the process of
            creating user interfaces. It includes some well thought out core libraries for
            working with data structures like Lists, Dicts, and Sets, and for managing
            Signals, which are fundamental to Elm's Functional Reactive Programming approach
            to managing changes in state. The package manager and module system are pleasant
            to use, and it also provides a useful <span class="hl">elm-reactor</span> command that serves your
            project on localhost and automatically builds on any changes, making it
            incredibly quick and easy to get started.
        </p><p>
            You can run the following code snippets either from the
            <a href="http://elm-lang.org/try/">online editor</a> or by
            <a href="http://elm-lang.org/install/">installing it</a>, and then creating a directory
            with a Main.elm file in it and running <span class="hl">elm-reactor</span>.
        </p><h2>Hola Hell!</h2><p>
            Here's the standard Hello World using only the core libraries, and demonstrating
            the module system, the type annotations, and the left pipe operator <span class="hl">&lt;|</span> that is
            used for evaluating the <span class="hl">Text.fromString "Hello World!"â€‹</span> expression before
            passing it to the <span class="hl">leftAligned</span> function.
        </p><pre><code>import Graphics.Element exposing (Element, leftAligned)
import Text

main : Element
main = leftAligned &lt;| Text.fromString "Hello World!"</code></pre><p>
            As you can see, everything is explicitly defined with none of the global
            variables that you encounter with Javascript.  The main function is the point at
            which the app is evaluated altogether to display on the screen, and as such must
            return an Element type, refering to the HTML Element that will end up in the DOM.
        </p><h2>Signal (Int, Int)</h2><p>
            The following example (taken from <a href="http://elm-lang.org/examples/">http://elm-lang.org/examples</a>) demonstrates the
            Signal concept that forms the basis of Elm's Functional Reactive Programming
            approach:
        </p><pre><code>import Graphics.Element exposing (Element, show)
import Mouse

main : Signal Element
main =
    Signal.map show Mouse.position</code></pre><p>
            In this case the main function returns a Signal Element, which can essentially
            be thought of as a list of Html Elements at each snapshot in time that an
            event has occured.  The Mouse library is used to get the position of the cursor, which
            returns a type of <span class="hl">Signal (Int, Int)</span> where Signal can again be considered to be
            a list of the <span class="hl">(Int, Int)</span> tuple that represents the x and y coordinates of
            the mouse at various points in time, for instance:
        </p><pre><code>[(0, 0)]                               -- Starting point at x = 0 and y = 0

[(0, 0), (10, 0)]                      -- Then moved to the right
[(0, 0), (10, 0), (10, 20)]            -- Then moved down
[(0, 0), (10, 0), (10, 20), (5, 10)]   -- Then moved to the left and up</code></pre><p>
            This is then mapped to the <span class="hl">show</span> function that returns the value as an Element:
        </p><pre><code>[(0, 0)]
[(0, 0), (10, 0)]
[(0, 0), (10, 0), (10, 20)]
[(0, 0), (10, 0), (10, 20), (5, 10)]</code></pre><p>
            The outcome in the browser is the last item of the Signal list, 
            representing the current state of the DOM body.
        </p><h2>1 = 1</h2><p>
            An important aspect of functional programming is to understand that the equals
            operator (=) is not used for assigning something to a variable, but actually
            signifies equality between the left and right sides just as it does in
            mathematical equations:
        </p><pre><code>-- For example, in maths:
-- 5 = 2 + 3
-- .. so an addition function in Elm would be:
add x y = x + y
-- which evaluates to:
add 2 3 = 2 + 3</code></pre><p>
            This means that the common idioms in imperative languages can't be used, such as
            <span class="hl">for (var = i; i &lt; list.length; i += 1) {...}</span>. Instead, lists of items are
            transformed by 'mapping' them to functions to return a new list with a different
            state, for example:
        </p><pre><code>-- Define a list of ones
ones = [1, 1, 1]
twos = List.map (\one -&gt; one * 2) ones</code></pre><p>
            This example uses a simple lambda function to double each item in the list.
            These are often useful for small functions that you are unlikely to use again.
            Here's how it would be written with a named function:
        </p><pre><code>-- Define a list of ones
ones = [1, 1, 1]
double it = it * 2
twos = List.map double ones</code></pre><h2>Precedence</h2><p>
            As with maths, you can specify what should be evaluated first with parentheses:
        </p><pre><code>addAndHalve x y = (x + y) / 2</code></pre><p>
            But Elm also provides two pipe operators (<span class="hl">|&gt;</span> and <span class="hl">&lt;|</span>) for different
            directions of evaluation:
        </p><pre><code>-- Evaluates x + y first then halves the result
addAndHalve x y = x + y |&gt; / 2

-- Evaluates x + y then passes the result to the halve function which returns
-- the final result
halve x = x / 2
addAndHalve x y = halve &lt;| x + y</code></pre><p>
            These might look strange, but it can be useful when describing a certain set of
            transformations in a particlular order:
        </p><pre><code>blueDot =
circle 10
    |&gt; filled blue
    |&gt; move (20,20)
    |&gt; scale 2</code></pre><p>
            This example evaluates a circle with radius 10 and applies it to the filled
            function to fill it with the colour blue, then takes this evaluation of this
            blue circle and applies it to the move function to move by (20, 20) and
            finally takes this evaluation of the blue circle that has been moved by
            (20, 20) and applies it to the scale function to multiply the scale by 2.
