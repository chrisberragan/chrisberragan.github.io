            In an attempt to bring some of the benefits of Elm to React, you can use
            Immutable JS to ensure that all state is immutable and Bacon JS to enable
            streams of events to handle the controllers. This approach differs slightly from
            the Elm Architecture approach in that the controllers are completely removed
            from the views (this approach doesn't need a single onClick or similiar
            attribute on any DOM elements).
        </p><p>
            
            Elm's approach to UIs is becoming increasingly popular for it's simplicity,
            clarity, and reliability (although the excellent type system helps somewhat here).
            In particular, having the state in a single immutable data-structure helps to
            avoid trippiing over yourself as the state changes as you no longer have to
            worry about the order in time that changes have been made to reason about what
            the result should be. Reactive events (Streams in Bacon JS and Signals in Elm)
            enable you to treat events as values in time that can be filtered to create new streams
            and mapped to alter the values.  With the controllers handled like this, it's simple
            to understand what the outcome of various events should be.  Finally using a reactive
            DOM library (VDOM in the case of Elm) not only has perfomance benefits thanks to the
            diffing of the changes that should be made to the DOM, but also provides a simple abstraction
            layer that ties in nicely with the event streams to make the view layer simply another
            transformation on the state (albeit one that has an effect that is rendered on the screen).
        </p><h2>Models Views Controllers</h2><p>
            The basic pattern is simply a variation on the classic MVC pattern.
        </p><h3>Controllers</h3><p>
            Starting with the controllers, the selectors for the views are stored together so that 
            they can be used by both the controllers and the views.  A Bacon Event Stream
            is created from events on the document that are then filtered by the ID or class
            and mapped to a functor that performs an action on the previous state:
        </p><pre><code>var SELECTORS = {
    updateMessageFieldId: 'update_message_field'
}

// Events
var keyups = Bacon.fromEvent(document, 'keyup');
    
// Controllers
var updateFieldEvents = keyups.filter(function (event) {
    // Filter by the ID of the element
    return event.target.id === SELECTORS.updateMessageFieldId;
})
.map(function (event) {
    // Return a functor to alter the previous state
    return function (previousState) {
        return previousState.set('message', event.target.value);
    };
});
// The main eventStream that merges all Controller streams into one
var eventStream = Bacon.mergeMany([
    updateFieldEvents
])</code></pre><h3>Models</h3><p>
            The models define an initial state and a current state stream that is defined by
            taking the eventStream and folding (eventStream.scan) it over the initial state
            to perform the actions on it:
        </p><pre><code>// Define the initial state of the app
const initialState = I.fromJS({
    message: 'Hello World!'
});

const currentStateStream = eventStream.scan(
    initialState,
    function (previousState, eventAction) {
        // Call the functor from the controller
        // to return a new altered version of the previous state
        return eventAction(previousState);
    }
);</code></pre><h3>Views</h3><p>
            Finally the currentStateStream is used to call Reacts render function to update
            the DOM with the evaluation of the React views with the updated state:
        </p><pre><code>currentStateStream.onValue(function (currentState) {
    // Render the main React component on changes to the state to update the UI
    render();
});</code></pre></article></main><footer><nav id="p-fnav"><ul><li><a href="./solid-principles-with-clojure.html">&larr; PREV</a></li><li><a href="#p-hdr">BACK TO TOP</a></li><li><a href="./getting-started-with-elm.html">NEXT &rarr;</a></li></ul></nav></footer></body></html>
